        Hi! My name is Raj.
        During Summer 2024 I enrolled onto the Couch to Coder programme which taught me the skills to create my own website from scratch. I pondered the question of what to dedicate my website to, and soon it became clear that I wanted to dedicate this website to the strongest female figure in my life - my nani ji.
    </p>

    <p>
        My nani ji, otherwise known as my grandma, has been visiting the UK from India since August 2024. I saw this as the ideal time to collect some of her incredible stories and to share her journey with the world. I hope you enjoy reading these stories as much as I enjoyed interviewing her.
    </p>
    <p>
        This website was possible with all of the skills I learnt from the Couch To Coder programme, watching countless hours of Youtube Tutorials and using resources on the internet. I am sincerly appreciative of all of the help that I received using these resources. 
    </p>

        How is my grandma doing today?
    </h2>

    <p>
        My nani ji is doing well. However, she suffered a fall in 2013 which injured her hip so she is unable to walk unaided. She moved to a town called Jagraon in India after her marriage and has continued to live there since.
