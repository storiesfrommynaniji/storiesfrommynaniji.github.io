        <p> Hi! My name is Raj! During Summer 2024 I enrolled onto the BRIGHT Network Couch to Coder programme which taught me the skills to create my own website from scratch. I pondered the question of what to dedicate my website to but it became clear that I wanted to dedicate this site to the strongest female figure in my life - my nani ji. 
      
        <p> My nani ji, otherwise known as my grandma, has been visiting the UK from India since August 2024. I saw this an the ideal time to collect some of her incredible stories and to share her journey through life with the world. I hope you enjoy reading these stories as much as I enjoyed interview her. </span>

        <h3>Childhood</h3>
        <p>
            My nani ji known as Harbans Kaur was born sometime around 1950. The date is not exact as it was not formally recorded, and her year of birth was “guesstimated” from the birth of her older brother. She was born at home in a village in rural Punjab called Gulib Kalan...

        <h3>To educate, or not to educate</h3>
        <p>
            None of my nani ji’s family had substantial education, although her father was educated to the equivalent of Year 5 curriculum in the UK.  When she was young, she was promised by her parents that she would be allowed to go to school when she was older. However...

        <h3>The birth of a boy</h3>
        <p>
            When my nani ji was pregnant with her second child, two years after my mum was born, she was encouraged by a few relatives to take medication that claimed to increase the chances of conceiving a boy. The medication supposedly had to be taken with fresh unpasteurised milk..
