        Childhood

    <p>
        My nani ji known as Harbans Kaur was born sometime around 1950. The date is not exact as it was not formally recorded, and her year of birth was “guesstimated” from the birth of her older brother. She was born at home in a village in rural Punjab called Gulib Kalan. Her family did not have a lot of money, and they lived in a small house constructed of clay and straw. The house had two rooms, and she lived with her parents, brother, grandparents, aunt and uncle. To protect the house from monsoon rainfall, she had to cover the ceilings and walls of the house with blankets. When the walls did cave in from the rain, her family had to reconstruct the walls using plastic bags filled with clay. They also did not have access to a toilet in the house and had to use neighbouring fields.  
    </p>

    <p>
     
        My grandma had a very tough childhood and stated that she was never truly able to live like a child. To earn a living, her parents rented a field where they grew wheat, cotton, sugar canes and peanuts. From a very early age, around 5 years old, she was made to harvest cotton from the fields earning as little as £1.50 a day. She was sometimes encouraged to earn extra income by working on neighbouring farms but when she wanted to collect her earnings, the owners of these farms became agitated, scaring her away. 
   
    </p>
        
    <p>
        Once the produce was ready to harvest, my nani ji collected these in bundles and carried them to processing sites, literally carrying the farm on her two shoulders. The juice of the sugar cane for example, was extracted to produce jaggery which is a common ingredient used in Indian cooking. Nothing harvested from the farm was made to go to waste and the scraps were always reutilised or fed to cattle.

        To educate, or to not educate

    <p>
        None of my nani ji’s family had substantial education, although her father was educated to the equivalent of Year 5 curriculum in the UK.  When she was young, she was promised by her parents that she would be allowed to go to school when she was bit older. However, her mum suddenly became unwell and needed an operation, pressuring her to stay and work on her parent’s farm and to earn a living to support and her family. 

    </p>
    <p>
        When my grandma was around 10 years old, a teacher from a local school was conducting an outreach programme to encourage rural children, especially girls, to enrol and attend at the local school. The majority of young girls in her village went to school after being persuaded by the teacher and she pleaded with her father to receive some education as it largely would benefit her and the family long term. Her father refused and stated that she was too old to go to school, forcing her to stay at home or continuing to work on the family fields. She was instead made to look after the household, at the age of 10.
    </p>

    <p>
        My grandma stated her lack of education as one of the limiting factors to her life and the journey of her life would have been a lot different had she received just primary education. The hardships she faced growing up may have been minimised or completely eradicated. She has since put a large emphasis on the importance of education, making sure my mum and her siblings all went to school. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Hearing my nani ji tell this story made me very emotional as I have just completed my master’s degree in mechanical engineering and I am incredibly grateful to have received the level of education without many barriers.

        The birth of a boy
    </h2>

    <p>
        During the 60s in India, it was often the tradition for people to get married young and also by arranged marriage. If you are unfamiliar with the term “arranged marriage”, it is the practice of allowing your family or a trusted individual to find and vet a partner on your behalf. It is often confused with forced marriage however you still do have complete choice on deciding your future partner. My nani ji wedded her husband through an arranged marriage when she was 22 years old. 
    </p>

    <p>
        My nani ji again struggled financially when she got married as my grandpa (my nana ji) had irregular income as a carpenter. She earned a living by keeping cattle at home and selling milk. When my grandma became pregnant with my mum, she was very unsupported by her family and was still working very close to labour. She gave birth at home to my mum in sweltering conditions.   The birth of a girl was not majorly valued at the time and was often seen as having a burden. This mindset unfortunately is still present in many Asian countries to this day. Many women as a result felt pressured to give birth to a baby boy to not upset the elders and to “continue“ the family lineage. 
    </p>

    <p>
        When my nani ji was pregnant with her second child, two years after my mum was born, she was encouraged by a few relatives to take medication that claimed to increase the chances of conceiving a boy. The medication supposedly had to be taken with fresh unpasteurised milk. My nani ji desperate to receive approval from her family, travelled a long distance to collect the medication despite all the potential risks and prayed that she would give birth to a boy.  Nine months later she gave birth to my uncle. It became clear to her that there was a preference for boys as the birth of my uncle was celebrated and revered.

    <h2>
        My nani ji's stories show that having access to education is life-changing, especially for girls in rural India. Many girls in rural India still do not have access to education. The National Sample Survey Office states that only 62.3% of rural girls in India are literate, compared to 80% of rural boys. 15.1 million girls are out of school according to the National Sample Survey Office. This needs to change. I have linked below some organisations which support girls' education across the world.
